F# Formatting Conventions
===

This article is written mostly based on ["F# Coding Guidelines"](http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/expert-fsharp-draft/FormattingConventions.doc) from Don Syme.
There are certain bits of the original documents which need to be updated when F# has changed a lot in last few years.
Therefore, I attempt to reintroduce F# Formatting Conventions here with some relevant information from other sources as well.
Another purpose of the article is to realize requirements for an F# code tidy tool I would like to create.
