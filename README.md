Fantomas
========

An F# source code formatter, similar to [scalariform](https://github.com/mdr/scalariform) for Scala, [ocp-indent](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent) for OCaml and [PythonTidy](https://github.com/acdha/PythonTidy) for Python.

## Purpose
This project aims at formatting F# source files based on a given configuration.
Fantomas will ensure correct indentation and consistent spacing between elements in the source files.
We assume that the source files are parsable by F# compiler before feeding into the tool.
Fantomas follows the formatting guideline being described in [A comprehensive guide to F# Formatting Conventions](FormattingConventions.md).

## Use cases
The project is developed with the following use cases in mind:
 - Reformatting an unfamiliar code base. It gives readability when you are not the one originally written the code.
 - Converting from verbose syntax to light syntax. 
Feeding a source file in verbose mode, Fantomas will format it appropriately in light mode.
This might be helpful for code generation since generating verbose source files is much easier.
For example, this code fragment

	```fsharp
	#light "off"
	let Multiple9x9 () = 
	  for i in 1 .. 9 do
	    printf "\n";
	    for j in 1 .. 9 do
	      let k = i * j in
	      printf "%d x %d = %2d " i j k;
	      done;
	  done;;
	Multiple9x9 ();;
	```	
is reformulated to 
	```fsharp
	let Multiple9x9() = 
	  for i in 1..9 do
	    printf "\n"
	    for j in 1..9 do
	      let k = i * j
	      printf "%d x %d = %2d " i j k
	
	Multiple9x9()
	```

 - Formatting F# signature files. It is useful if the signatures are hard to read due to being generated by F# compiler.

For more examples, please take a look at the [test cases](tests) taken from complex programs.

## Installation
The code base is written in F# 3.0/.NET framework 4.0. 
The solution file can be opened in Visual Studio 2012 and MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio.
NuGet is used to manage external packages.
The [test project](src/Fantomas.Tests) depends on FsUnit and NUNit.
However, the [library project](src/Fantomas) and [command line interface](src/Fantomas.Cmd) have no dependency on external packages.
