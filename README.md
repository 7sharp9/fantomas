Fantomas
========

An F# source code formatter, similar to [scalariform](https://github.com/mdr/scalariform) for Scala, [ocp-indent](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent) for OCaml and [PythonTidy](https://github.com/acdha/PythonTidy) for Python.

## Purpose
This project aims at formatting F# source files based on a given configuration.
Fantomas will ensure correct indentation and consistent spacing between elements in the source files.
We assume that the source files are parsable by F# compiler before feeding into the tool.
Fantomas follows the formatting guideline being described in [A comprehensive guide to F# Formatting Conventions](FormattingConventions.md).

## Use cases
The project is developed with the following use cases in mind:
 - Reformatting an unfamiliar code base. It gives readability when you are not the one originally written the code.
 - Converting from verbose syntax to light syntax. 
Feeding a source file in verbose mode, Fantomas will format it appropriately in light mode.
This might be helpful for code generation since generating verbose source files is much easier.
 - Formatting F# signature files. It is useful if the signatures are hard to read due to being generated by F# compiler.
